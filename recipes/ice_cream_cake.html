        <ol>
            <li>Preheat to oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Adjust an oven rack to upper-middle position. Spray a donut 
                pan with cooking spray.

            <li>Pour melted and cooled shortening into flour mixture and stir until absorbed. Add buttermilk mixture and mix 
                well. Let batter rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven on the upper-middle rack until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. 
                Remove from the oven; let cool in the pan for 2 to 3 minutes before removing onto a wire rack.
            </li>
            <li>Place powdered sugar into a small paper bag. Toss warm doughnuts in powdered sugar to coat.</li>
            <li>Spray the donut pan with cooking spray again. Spoon batter in tablespoonfuls into the hot pan for the next batch.</li>
            <li> Bake donuts in the preheated oven on the upper-middle rack until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool for 2 to 3 
                minutes before removing from the pan and toss in powdered sugar.</li>
